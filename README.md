ðŸ§  EEG-Based Depression Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains a project designed to detect signs of depression from EEG (electroencephalogram) signals using deep learning techniques, specifically the DenseNet architecture. The entire workflow â€” including preprocessing, training, and evaluation â€” was developed using Google Colab.



âœ¨ Highlights

âœ… Signal preprocessing: filtering and normalization of raw EEG data  
âœ… Deep learning model: CNN-based architecture (DenseNet)  
âœ… Evaluation using visual performance metrics like accuracy and loss curves
